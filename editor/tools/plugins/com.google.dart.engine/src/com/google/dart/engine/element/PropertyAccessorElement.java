 * The following rules apply:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Every explicit field is represented by a non-synthetic {@link FieldElement}.
 * <li>Every explicit field induces a getter and possibly a setter, both of which are represented by
 * synthetic {@link PropertyAccessorElement}s.
 * <li>Every explicit getter or setter is represented by a non-synthetic
 * {@link PropertyAccessorElement}.
 * <li>Every explicit getter or setter (or pair thereof if they have the same name) induces a field
 * that is represented by a synthetic {@link FieldElement}.
 * </ul>
