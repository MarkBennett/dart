/**
 * The class {@code Instrumentation} implements support for logging instrumentation information.
 * <p>
 * Instrumentation information consists of information about specific operations. Those operations
 * can range from user-facing operations, such as saving the changes to a file, to internal
 * operations, such as tokenizing source code. The information to be logged is gathered by
 * {@link InstrumentationBuilder instrumentation builder}, created by one of the static methods on
 * this class such as {@link #builder(Class)} or {@link #builder(String)}.
 * <p>
 * Note, however, that until an instrumentation logger is installed using the method
 * {@link #setLogger(InstrumentationLogger)}, all instrumentation data will be lost.
 * <p>
 * <b>Example</b>
 * <p>
 * To collect metrics about how long it took to save a file, you would write something like the
 * following:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * InstrumentationBuilder instrumentation = Instrumentation.builder(this.getClass());
 * // save the file
 * instrumentation.metric("chars", fileLength).log();
 * </pre>
 * The {@code Instrumentation.builder} method creates a new {@link InstrumentationBuilder
 * instrumentation builder} and records the time at which it was created. The
 * {@link InstrumentationBuilder#metric(String, long)} appends the information specified by the
 * arguments and records the time at which the method is called so that the time to complete the
 * save operation can be calculated. The {@code log} method tells the builder that all of the data
 * has been collected and that the resulting information should be logged.
 *
