/**
 * The interface <code>Buffer</code> defines the behavior of objects that contain the contents of a
 * resource. It is not language-specific. The contents of the buffer might be in the process of
 * being edited, differing from the actual contents of the underlying resource. If a buffer does not
 * have an underlying resource, saving the buffer has no effect. Buffers can be read-only.
 * <p>
 * Note that Dart model operations that manipulate a <code>Buffer</code> (for example,
 * <code>Type.createMethod(...)</code>) ensure that the same line delimiter (either
 * <code>"\n"</code> or <code>"\r"</code> or <code>"\r\n"</code>) is used across the whole buffer.
 * Thus these operations may change the line delimiter(s) included in the string to be append, or
 * replaced. However, implementers of this interface should be aware that other clients of
 * <code>Buffer</code> might not do such transformations beforehand.
 * <p>
 * This interface may be implemented by clients.
