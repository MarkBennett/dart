/**
 * The abstract class <code>CategorizedProblem</code> implements behavior common to problems that
 * have a category associated with them. This provides a richer description of a Dart problem, as
 * detected by the compiler or some of the underlying technology reusing the compiler. With the
 * introduction of <code>CompilationParticipant</code>, the simpler problem interface
 * {@link Problem} did not carry enough information to better separate and categorize Dart problems.
 * In order to minimize impact on existing API, Dart problems are still passed around as
 * {@link Problem}, though actual implementations should explicitly extend
 * {@link CategorizedProblem}. Participants can produce their own problem definitions, and given
 * these are categorized problems, they can be better handled by clients (such as user interface).
 * <p>
 * A categorized problem provides access to:
 * <ul>
 * <li>its location (originating source file name, source position, line number),</li>
 * <li>its message description and a predicate to check its severity (warning or error).</li>
 * <li>its ID : a number identifying the very nature of this problem. All possible IDs for standard
 * Dart problems are listed as constants on {@link Problem},</li>
 * <li>its marker type : a string identifying the problem creator. It corresponds to the marker type
 * chosen if this problem was to be persisted. Standard Dart problems are associated to marker type
 * {@link DartCore#?}),</li>
 * <li>its category ID : a number identifying the category this problem belongs to. All possible IDs
 * for standard Dart problem categories are listed in this class.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Note: the compiler produces Problems internally, which are turned into markers by the DartBuilder
 * so as to persist problem descriptions. This explains why there is no API allowing to reach
 * Problem detected when compiling. However, the Dart problem markers carry equivalent information
 * to Problem, in particular their ID (attribute "id") is set to one of the IDs defined on this
 * interface.
 * <p>
 * Note: Standard Dart problems produced by Dart default tooling will be subclasses of this class.
 * Technically, most API methods dealing with problems are referring to {@link Problem} for backward
 * compatibility reason. It is intended that {@link CategorizedProblem} will be subclassed for
 * custom problem implementation when participating in compilation operations, so as to allow
 * participant to contribute their own marker types, and thus defining their own domain specific
 * problem/category IDs.
 * <p>
 * Note: standard Dart problems produced by Dart default tooling will set the marker
 * <code> IMarker#SOURCE_ID</code> attribute to <code> DartBuilder#SOURCE_ID</code>; compiler
 * participants may specify the <code> IMarker#SOURCE_ID</code> attribute of their markers by adding
 * it to the extra marker attributes of the problems they generate; markers resulting from compiler
 * participants' problems that do not have the <code> IMarker#SOURCE_ID</code> extra attribute set
 * do not have the <code> DartBuilder#SOURCE_ID</code> attribute set either.
