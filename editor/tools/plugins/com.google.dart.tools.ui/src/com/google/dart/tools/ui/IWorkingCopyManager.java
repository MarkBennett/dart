/**
 * Interface for accessing working copies of <code>CompilationUnit</code> objects. The original
 * compilation unit is only given indirectly by means of an <code>IEditorInput</code>. The life
 * cycle is as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li> <code>connect</code> creates and remembers a working copy of the compilation unit which is
 * encoded in the given editor input</li>
 * <li> <code>getWorkingCopy</code> returns the working copy remembered on <code>connect</code></li>
 * <li> <code>disconnect</code> destroys the working copy remembered on <code>connect</code></li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * In order to provide backward compatibility for clients of <code>IWorkingCopyManager</code>,
 * extension interfaces are used to provide a means of evolution. The following extension interfaces
 * exist:
 * <ul>
 * <li> {@link com.google.dart.tools.ui.IWorkingCopyManagerExtension} since version 2.1 introducing
 * API to set and remove the working copy for a given editor input.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 * </p>
 * * Provisional API: This class/interface is part of an interim API that is still under development
 * and expected to change significantly before reaching stability. It is being made available at
 * this early stage to solicit feedback from pioneering adopters on the understanding that any code
 * that uses this API will almost certainly be broken (repeatedly) as the API evolves.
