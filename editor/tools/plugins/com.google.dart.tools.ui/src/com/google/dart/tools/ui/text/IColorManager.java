 * In order to provide backward compatibility for clients of <code>IColorManager</code>, extension
 * interfaces are used to provide a means of evolution. The following extension interfaces exist:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link com.google.dart.tools.ui.text.config.IColorManagerExtension} since version 2.0
 * introducing the ability to bind and un-bind colors.</li>
 * </ul>

 * This interface may be implemented by clients.

 * Provisional API: This class/interface is part of an interim API that is still under development
 * and expected to change significantly before reaching stability. It is being made available at
 * this early stage to solicit feedback from pioneering adopters on the understanding that any code
 * that uses this API will almost certainly be broken (repeatedly) as the API evolves.
