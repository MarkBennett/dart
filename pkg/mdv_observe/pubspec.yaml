  Observable properties and objects for use in Model-Driven-Views (MDV).
  MDV extends HTML and the DOM APIs to support a sensible separation between the
  UI (DOM) of a document or application and its underlying data (model).
  Updates to the model are reflected in the DOM and user input into the DOM is
  immediately assigned to the model.
