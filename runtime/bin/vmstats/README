This is the VM Stats program built into the Dart executable.

These files are converted into binary resources during the build, and
linked into the Dart executable so it is self-contained. These resources
are available via a built-in HTTP server, enabled with the --stats flag.

Since dart2js requires the dart executable, the vm_stats.dart.js file is
not re-created with the build. Instead, it should be regenerated whenever
any of the dart files change, and committed with those changes.  To
regenerate, from this directory run:

  $ ../../../out/ReleaseIA32/dart-sdk/bin/dart2js -ovmstats.dart.js \
      vmstats.dart
