Chat server
-----------

This sample implements a simple chat server using Dart for both the
client and server code. The server is implementing a sub-set of the
HTTP protocol using the socket support in the Dart VM. The client is
implemented using the Dart DOM API and compiled to JavaScript for
running in the browser.

How to run
----------

First of all make sure that the Dart VM and Dart compiler are build by
running the following from the root of the Dart checkout:

$ tools/build.py --arch=ia32 --mode=release

All the commands below should be executed in the samples/chat
directory.

$ cd samples/chat

First step is to compile the client Dart source into JavaScript for
the browser.

on linux,
$ ../../out/ReleaseIA32/dart2js dart_client/chat.dart

on a Mac,
$ ../../xcodebuild/ReleaseIA32/dart2js dart_client/chat.dart

This will create the JavaScript for the Dart application in the out.js
file.

Next step is to start the server

on linux,
$ ../../out/ReleaseIA32/dart chat_server.dart

on a Mac,
$ ../../xcodebuild/ReleaseIA32/dart chat_server.dart

Now navigate you Chrome browser to http://localhost:8123 and start
chatting.
