Dartcombat is a sample game which illustrates how to use isolate communication
and futures.

Building and running:

1. go to the top-level directory of the project:
  $ cd dart/

2. build the dartc compiler:
  $ ./tools/build.py --arch=ia32

3. either compile the Dart code to JavaScript, or load the code directly into
   Dartium:

   - to compile the code:
     $(DART_SDK)/bin/dart2js --out=dartcombat.dart.js dartcombat.dart

4. open the generated file in a browser (either Dartium, Chrome, or another
   supported browser):
  $ google-chrome dartcombat.html

Using dartcombat:

Dartcombat works as follows:
- screen: The screen shows 4 grids. On the left is what player1 knows (his board
  in detail, and his partial knowledge of player2's board), on the right is what
  player2 knows.

- setup: You can place boats on the top boards by clicking and dragging the
  mouse.

- shooting: You can shoot by clicking on the bottom grids. To highlight isolate
  communication and futures, we made each click a supershoot: if a boat is hit,
  the player will automatically scan all cells around the initial shot, and
  progresively hit the boat and sink it.
