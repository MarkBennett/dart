'hi' is a simple 'hello world' Dart application that runs in the browser.

Building and running:

1. go to the top-level directory of the project:
  $ cd dart/

2. build the dartc compiler:
  $ ./tools/build.py --arch=ia32

3. either compile the Dart code to JavaScript, or load the code directly into
   Dartium:

   - to compile the code:
     $(DART_SDK)/bin/dart2js --out=hi.dart.js hi.dart

4. open the generated file in a browser (either Dartium, Chrome, or another
   supported browser):
  $ google-chrome hi.html
