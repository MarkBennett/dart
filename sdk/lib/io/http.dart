 * The [HttpClient] class implements the client side of the HTTP

 * first future completes with a [HttpClientRequest] the underlying
 * network connection has been established, but no data has yet been
 * sent. The HTTP headers and body can be set on the request, and
 * [:close:] is called to sent it to the server.
 *
 * The second future, which is returned by [:close:], completes with
 * an [HttpClientResponse] object when the response is received from
 * the server. This object contains the headers and body of the
 * response.

 * The future for [HttpClientRequest] is created by methods such as
 * [getUrl] and [open].
 *
 * When the HTTP response is ready a [HttpClientResponse] object is
 * provided which provides access to the headers and body of the response.
 *
 *     HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
 *     client.getUrl(Uri.parse("http://www.example.com/"))
 *         .then((HttpClientRequest request) {
 *           // Prepare the request then call close on it to send it.

 *         })
 *         .then((HttpClientResponse response) {
 *          // Process the response.
 *         });
 *
 * All [HttpClient] requests set the following header by default:
 *
 *     Accept-Encoding: gzip
 *
 * This allows the HTTP server to use gzip compression for the body if
 * possible. If this behavior is not desired set the
 * "Accept-Encoding" header to something else.
 *
 * The [HttpClient] supports persistent connections and caches network
 * connections to reuse then for multiple requests whenever
 * possible. This means that network connections can be kept open for
 * some time after a request have completed. Use [:HttpClient.close:]
 * to force shut down the [HttpClient] object and close the idle
 * network connections.
 *
 * By default the HttpClient uses the proxy configuration available
 * from the environment, see [findProxyFromEnvironment]. To turn off
 * the use of proxies all together set the [findProxy] property to
