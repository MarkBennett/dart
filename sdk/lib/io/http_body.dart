/**
 * [HttpBodyHandler] is a helper class for parsing and collecting HTTP message
 * data in an easy-to-use [HttpBody] object. The content body is parsed,
 * depending on the 'Content-Type' header field.
 *
 * To use with the [HttpServer] for request messages, [HttpBodyHandler] can be
 * used as either a [StreamTransformer] or as a per-request handler (see
 * [processRequest]).
 *
 *     HttpServer server = ...
 *     server.transform(new HttpBodyHandler())
 *         .listen((HttpRequestBody body) {
 *           ...
 *         });
 *
 * To use with the [HttpClient] for response messages, [HttpBodyHandler] can be
 * used as a per-request handler (see [processResponse]).
 *
 *     HttpClient client = ...
 *     client.get(...)
 *         .then((HttpClientRequest response) => response.close())
 *         .then(HttpBodyHandler.processResponse)
 *         .then((HttpClientResponseBody body) {
 *           ...
 *         });
 *
 * The following mime-types will be handled specially:
 *   - text/\*
 *   - application/json
 *
 * All other mime-types will be returned as [List<int>].
