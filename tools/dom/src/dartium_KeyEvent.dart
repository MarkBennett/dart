/**
 * A custom KeyboardEvent that attempts to eliminate cross-browser
 * inconsistencies, and also provide both keyCode and charCode information
 * for all key events (when such information can be determined).
 *
 * KeyEvent tries to provide a higher level, more polished keyboard event
 * information on top of the "raw" [KeyboardEvent].
 *
 * This class is very much a work in progress, and we'd love to get information
 * on how we can make this class work with as many international keyboards as
 * possible. Bugs welcome!
